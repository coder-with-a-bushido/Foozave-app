# Foozave

Foozave is an app targeting on reducing the food wastage by sharing it with others who need it.

The user can both post the food they have in extras with contact details, location, and the time till it will available to pick up and also view posts from others within 10Km range(so that only relevant posts are shown) in the map as markers.

The posts are deleted automatically once the "time till they are available" is reached so that it's easy for users to only see appropriate/useful posts.
